Tests that the JIT fails
{
    ProcessTest
}

Tests that the intrp fails
{
    ProcessTest
    ThreadLocalTest
}

ProcessTest works for both cases now?? I think the stuff
that somehow triggered was the METHOD_INDIRECT and associated macro

There might be some problem with soft_lookup_method
In the case of JIT it returns meth->ncode
In the case of INT it returns meth
What happens when we mix??
