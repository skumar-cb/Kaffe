Tests that the JIT fails
{
    ProcessTest
}

Tests that the intrp fails
{
    ProcessTest
    ThreadLocalTest
}

ProcessTest works for both cases now?? I think the stuff
that somehow triggered was the METHOD_INDIRECT and associated macro

There might be some problem with soft_lookup_method
In the case of JIT it returns meth->ncode
In the case of INT it returns meth
What happens when we mix??

JNI stuff
{
    It is not very clear what happens when we call native methods
    from the intrp or the JIT environment
}

1. Unified: Single executable
2. BasicMix: Basic stuff in mix modes work
3. GoodMix:  Mix modes seems to work well, in mixJIT we JIT any on 2nd time
